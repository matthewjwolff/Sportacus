SQL files
=========

Contained in this folder are all the SQL scripts necessary to populate the
database. A shell script ``populate_postgres.sh`` is provided to automate the
population of the database. It assumes the usage of PostgreSQL. Using that
script is preferred to ensure executing the scripts in the proper order.
