SQL files
=========

Contained in this folder are all the SQL scripts necessary to populate the
database. Use a breadth-first ordering to execute the scripts in the correct
order.

A shell script ``populate_postgres.sh`` is provided to automate the population
of the database. It assumes the usage of PostgreSQL.
