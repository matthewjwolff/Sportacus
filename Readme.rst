Sports-themed database project for CSC 4402 with Dr. Jianhua Chen

Project Structure
-----------------

The ``doc`` folder contains all documentation about the project. Namely it 
contains the PowerPoint presentation used for the in-class presentation and 
the project report. 

The ``sql`` folder contains the source code for the project. It contains 
``.sql`` scripts for generating the database and performing some sample 
queries upon it. There is also a shell script that automates this process for 
the PostgreSQL and MySQL DBMSs.

The ``etc`` folder contains extraneous files used for project maintenance. 
These files need not be examined.
